# aStarPythonVisualized
Personal Project made in python to show the A* graph traversal algorithm. I use pygame for a better visualization
# How to play:
* First click will set a starting cell
* Second click will set an ending cell
* Any other clicks will draw barriers
* Space will start the algorithm
* "C" will clear the screen
